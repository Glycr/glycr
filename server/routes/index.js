// ── Mount order rationale ──
//
// All sub-routers define disjoint path prefixes (auth/*, admin/*, staff/*,
// etc.), so order is theoretically arbitrary. It becomes meaningful only if
// two sub-routers accidentally define the same method+path — the first one
// mounted wins, the second is dead code with no warning.
//
// To verify no shadowing exists, run at boot (dev only):
//   const listEndpoints = require('express-list-endpoints');
//   console.table(listEndpoints(app));
// Duplicate method+path pairs in the output indicate a collision.
//
// The current order groups related domains: auth/staff first (login paths),
// public resources next (events/tickets/waitlists), then user-scoped
// (payouts/settings), then admin (last, since it's the most-specific prefix).

// ── Auth + staff ──
// Login surfaces. /staff/pin-login should be mounted with authLimiter inside
// staff.js — verify the route file includes it, otherwise PIN brute-force is
// unbounded.
router.use(authRoutes);
router.use(staffRoutes);

// ── Public-facing reads ──
// Event browsing, ticket purchase (guest + auth), waitlist join (guest + auth).
// These are the endpoints a logged-out visitor hits.
router.use(eventRoutes);
router.use(ticketRoutes);

// ── Authenticated user scope ──
// Data scoped to req.user.id — payouts (organizer), settings (self), refunds
// (self + organizer), analytics (organizer), coupons (organizer), service
// requests (submit + admin list), messages (admin-only).
router.use(payoutRoutes);
router.use(userSettingsRoutes);
router.use(refundRoutes);

// ── User CRUD (admin) ──
// All endpoints in users.js should be requireAdmin-gated.
router.use(userRoutes);

// ── Admin (mounted last) ──
// Every endpoint here needs requireAdmin. If any admin route is
// accidentally reachable without requireAdmin, this is the highest-value
// target — admin can manage users, delete events, approve payouts, wipe logs.
router.use(adminRoutes);

// ── Notifications ──
// Currently disabled. The notificationController was flagged during the
// controller review as a spam/phishing/toll-fraud gateway: it lets any
// authenticated caller send arbitrary emails/SMS through Resend/Twilio.
// Nothing in the codebase calls it. Re-enable ONLY after either:
//   (a) deleting notificationController.js + routes/notifications.js entirely, OR
//   (b) adding requireAdmin to every route in notifications.js AND
//       rate-limiting to prevent budget exhaustion.
//
